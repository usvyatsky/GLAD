# GLAD - Gateway-LAmbda-DynamoDB AWS-hosted stack automation

## Synopsis

GLAD is a set of scripts (bash at the moment) that automate and streamline creation of custom Web application backend GLAD stacks in AWS - the Amazon cloud.

## Code Example


## Motivation

GLAD stack is a great rapid prototyping tool.
Using AWS API Gateway, Lambda function(s) and noSQL DynamoDb one can create a backend for a Web application almost instantly. Except, setting up the stack itself is a multi-step process that is quite involved and not always intuitive.
This toolkit aims to automate creation of such stacks using AWS CLI.

## Installation

Just clone the project and run the scripts.

## API Reference


## Tests

Running the main script without any arguments should produce an example stack as described in the following AWS tutorial: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/with-on-demand-https-example.html
